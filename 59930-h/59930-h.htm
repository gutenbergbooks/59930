<small>THE HIGH STONE WALLS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the world was made, a number of
islands were loosely scattered around at the
mouth of the Hudson River. To this day,
the old river works steadily on, trying to
change the saltness of the Atlantic by pouring
in fresh water, and trying to widen its
own mouth by washing away these islands,
but the ocean is as salt as it was a thousand
years ago and the islands are of about the
same size that they ever were, so far as anybody
can see. When they were put there,
however, and for nobody knows how long
afterward, there was not a boy or girl to
have been found upon either of them, while
nowadays there are swarms and swarms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
from every nation this side of Asia, and
they are of all sorts and sizes.</p>

<p>Some of the ways and doings of those boys
and girls cannot be rightly told without first
asking those who are to hear the story to
take a look at a map of New York City and
of the land and water around it. The map
shows everything pretty clearly excepting
the people and the houses they live in.</p>

<p>One of the boys belonging to this story
might have required a sharp search to find
him, on a particular morning, early in the
spring. Not that he seemed to be hiding, or
that he was alone. On the contrary, he
stood nearly in the middle of a long line of
boys. There were over four hundred of
them, dressed all alike, in jackets and trousers
of dark, thick gray cloth. Their caps
and shoes were of the same pattern, all
along the line.</p>

<p>Stationed at intervals, here and there,
were boys no larger than the rest, in uniforms
of dark, but bright blue cloth, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
red stripes on their arms, and these were
officers and this was a battalion, and it was
marching briskly forward to the spirited
music of half a dozen drums and several
shrill fifes.</p>

<p>It was a kind of charge, across the level,
gravelly parade-ground, and the boys were
marching well, but right before them stood
a high and frowning stone wall and it was of
no use to charge against it. It could neither
be broken through nor climbed and this one
boy, in the middle of the line, was staring
at it as if he hated it, while he marched.
His feet kept time with the music and perfect
pace with the feet of the other boys,
but there was an angry look in his black
eyes and a hot flush on his face, as if the
wall had spoken to him, saying something to
rouse his temper and make him answer
back. What he did say, was, in a whisper
that the next boy to him heard:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will!&mdash;See if I don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; whispered the other boy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go over it, some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you, then. I can climb anything
you can&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Halt!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The clear-voiced command was at that instant
heard, all along the line, and every boy
stood still in his tracks.</p>

<p>They were a pretty well drilled battalion.</p>

<p>&#8220;About,&mdash;<i>face</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>In an instant the long, double lines stood,
with their backs to the wall and facing the
parade-ground.</p>

<p>Away out in the middle of it stood the
commander, the drill-master of that very remarkable
battalion. He was a handsome,
pleasant eyed man, of about twenty-five,
dressed in a trim blue uniform, very like
that of a United States Army officer. He
was really a naval officer, detailed there by
the Government to be practically the colonel
of a regiment of pretty wild boys. He was
there to teach them discipline, order, obedience,
only a shade or so more strictly than if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
they had been cadets at West Point, or the
Naval Academy at Annapolis.</p>

<p>Other commands had been given and
obeyed, and the entire force was now marching
around the broad enclosure by companies,
six of them, and each company was
composed of boys of nearly the same height.</p>

<p>The first company consisted of boys, the
oldest of whom may have been eighteen, and
the rear company was made up of little fellows
as young as twelve, or even younger.</p>

<p>Very nearly all of them, white or colored,
moved as if they liked the idea of being
young soldiers, but they had not been recruited
like other soldiers. Some of them
were there because they had no other home
to go to nor any other school to be taught in.
Many, however, were there for other reasons.
For instance, that tall young fellow in command
of the foremost company. The captain,
in bright, blue uniform who handled
his men so well. He is here for highway
robbery and it will be a long time before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
they let him out, although he is one of the
best behaved boys in the House of Refuge.
He is not here altogether as a punishment,
however, nor are any of his companions, no
matter what their fault was. This is not a
place of judgment, but of help and hope, and,
not long ago, a well-known literary man, after
inspecting the whole institution, said to the
Superintendent:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, this is one of the footprints of Christ
on earth. It is an effort, in His name, to
seek and to save that which was lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; replied the officer.
&#8220;About eighty-five out of every hundred
do well and become good citizens. We keep
track of them, long after they leave us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the House of Refuge has to
be a kind of prison. It is on Randall&#8217;s
Island, separated from the city of New York,
on Manhattan Island, by a swiftly running
branch of the East River, which is not a
river at all, but an arm of the sea, and its
rapid current is made by the changing tides.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>If, in one view, this is a prison, in another
it is a great boarding school, with very remarkable
appliances for the education and
discipline of its pupils.</p>

<p>The entire enclosure, of which the parade-ground
is a part, contains several acres.
The stone wall, twenty feet high, in front of
which the battalion halted, guards all of one
of the sides of the enclosure and parts of
two other sides.</p>

<p>The remaining lengths of those two are
protected just as well by high buildings but
on the southern side a tall chimney sticks up
from a range of buildings that are not so
high. They contain a steam engine, machinery
and several kinds of workshops.</p>

<p>The drill was long and must have been
tiresome, particularly to the boy who carried
and pounded the big, bass drum and to the
other boy who carried the flag. It all but
blew him over, more than once, for there
were sharp gusts of March wind, now and
then. He looked relieved, very much so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
when the battalion at last halted on the side
nearest the green lawn and the buildings, and
was ordered to &#8220;break ranks.&#8221;</p>

<p>That command dispersed the young soldiers
and sent them off to fun of their own
making, just as the order to assemble for
drill had found them, scattered here and
there. It had not been a regular &#8220;school
day&#8221; and none of them had been in the
vast schoolroom in the main building, busy
with books. At the moment when the military
instructor&#8217;s whistle had sounded, a
brisk game of base ball had been going on
in the ball ground, next to the parade-ground.
On that itself, a number of knots
of boys had been skylarking. Most of them
had been indoors, however, and of these,
some had been in the conservatory, learning
to be gardeners; others in the printing shop;
in the tailor-shop; in the shoe-shop; in the
stocking factory; in the carpenter shop;
in the rope and matting shop; and so
on. It was not the season for farm work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and none had been away outside, on the
island farm learning to be farmers as they
soon were to be, later in the spring. Moreover,
the model ship, in front of the main
building, toward the East River, had a deserted
look, but it was waiting for the boys
to come, crew after crew, and play sailors
under the nautical instructor. In that way
many of them were to get themselves ready
to go to sea, really some day.</p>

<p>Jim, the boy who had hated the wall, had
been in the printing shop, and he had walked
out of it with a look on his face as if he did
not care much for drill or for printing or for
anything else. He was a tall, wiry looking
boy, of not much over fourteen, and he
might have seemed even good looking if he
had not been so downcast. That was hardly
the right word for it, either, for right along
with what some people might have mistaken
for sullenness was another look that was full
of the most determined pluck. It had stuck
to his face during drill-time and had grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
stronger when he stared at the wall. It was
there now, as he walked along with the other
boys, toward the entrance of the shop buildings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t belong here!&#8221; came out in another
whisper, that nobody heard. &#8220;I never
did it! I never did it! I&#8217;ve been here long
enough! I won&#8217;t stay any longer. I&#8217;m going
to climb that wall, somehow. I&#8217;m going
to be free and go where I choose!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was it. He was struggling with a
sense of injustice, in some way done him,
and it was stirred up to unusual bitterness
by a longing for freedom. It was as natural
as breathing to hate to be shut in and to
hate the wall and to study how it could be
climbed over, and to dream of all the wonderful
things beyond it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim!&#8221; said a boy of his own size who
was walking with him. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do it!&mdash;You
can&#8217;t even get a chance to try.&mdash;Then,
if you did get out, there&#8217;s the East River to
cross and we never could swim it. What&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
more, if we got to New York, we&#8217;d be
known by our clothes and the cops would
catch us and send us back. It&#8217;s no use!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, though,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;You see if
I don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t belong here!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he added, in his hot and angry
thoughts, but not aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been here a whole year and I ought
not to have been sent here. I didn&#8217;t do it!&mdash;I
never stole a cent of that money,&mdash;I
don&#8217;t care what they say.&mdash;When I get out,
though, I won&#8217;t go back to uncle John&#8217;s
house. He&#8217;s as hard as flint. Aunt Betty
isn&#8217;t, though. I&#8217;d like to see her. She tried
to keep me from being sent here.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II<br />

<small>SUPPER TIME</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> boy has ears keen enough to hear a
woman who is speaking fifty miles away
from him. Nevertheless, Jim might have
been glad to hear what a woman was saying,
in a farmhouse away up the Hudson, at the
very moment when the battalion he was in
was halted in front of the wall. She was a
kindly faced, middle aged woman, and she
was speaking with more energy than seemed
naturally to belong to her, for she did not
look energetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Bronson,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I suppose you
did what you thought was right, but I never
did believe Jim took that money!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; sharply responded a large, heavy
looking man, who sat near her. &#8220;You are
all wrong! Nobody else could possibly have
taken it. The court said so. Jim was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
only one who could have got at it, anyhow.
Besides, he was seen a spending money in the
village, too. He took it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never believe it!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t care how they made it look. He never
confessed it, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim always was obstinate, and you know
it,&#8221; said her husband, sternly. &#8220;He never
would give in. The House of Refuge men&#8217;ll
bring him to his senses, though. He&#8217;ll
learn something, there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been there a whole year,&#8221; she
said, sadly enough. &#8220;O, how I want to see
him, sometimes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Something else cut off the talk about Jim,
at that point. He did not hear the remarks
of Aunt Betty, or Uncle John, but it was
just as impossible for any boy or girl on Randall&#8217;s
Island,&mdash;for there were many girls
there,&mdash;to have heard what people were saying,
over in the great city, so near at hand.
Part of that city of New York is on Manhattan
Island, but a larger part, with not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
nearly so many people in it, is on the mainland, above
the arm of the sea known as
Harlem River. It begins just above the
upper end of Randall&#8217;s Island.</p>

<p>Away up in that new part of the city, a
girl of about Jim&#8217;s age, and a boy who may
have been a little older but was no taller,
were standing in front of another kind of
stone wall and were talking about it.</p>

<p>This wall was about twelve feet high and
was roughly made, with a rugged face, very
different from the smooth finish of the barrier
around the parade-ground. In fact it
was nothing at all but the side of a new
street. An old road which once had run
along there had been contented to go down
into a hollow and come up again on the
higher ground beyond. Now, however, that
the city had spread out and taken in all that
land, it had been best to make a level. All
high places were cut down and across all low
places the streets were carried on &#8220;viaducts.&#8221;
These left the ground on either side of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a street away down below it, looking more
of a hollow than ever.</p>

<p>One of these streets was a broad avenue,
promising to be good looking after it was
finished, but very ugly now. It was so much
wider than the old road it was taking the
place of that it cut off an old front yard entirely,
and the house there which had been a
number of feet from its old front gate was
now almost exactly on a line with the stone
wall at the edge of the avenue. That was
the reason why the girl looked hard at the
wall and at the house and then turned to the
boy, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Rodney Nelson! Your folks are
just walled in! How on earth are you going
to get out?&#8221;</p>

<p>It looked like it, for the side streets, crossing
the avenue at the ends of the square,
were built up in the same way and on the
fourth side, to which their backs were
turned, were the backs of a solid row of
buildings, fronting upon another avenue.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get over that wall,&#8221; said Rodney.
&#8220;Billy&#8217;s tried it, everywhere, and he
can climb anything that isn&#8217;t straight up and
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to be pretty cheerful about it,
nevertheless, whoever Billy might be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell you what,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you can come
across and get out through our house and the
shop, till you can put up some stairs, or a
ladder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll have to,&#8221; replied Rodney,
&#8220;but Billy&#8217;s got to stay at home, now. They
finished the last of that wall, this morning.
Come on upstairs and see how mother&#8217;s going
to get in, this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>In half a minute more they were up in the
room over the parlor and she at once remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;O! I see! your mother&#8217;ll climb in at the
second story windows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t have to climb,&#8221; said Rodney.
&#8220;Look here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Nelson house was old, but it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
large. That second story had but four
rooms, two of them of good size, two of
them, at each end of its entry, quite small.
The large front room, however, had an ample
bay window that jutted out, now, almost
over the edge of the wall. That was not
the window Rodney went to, but the one in
the little room on the left, and he had it
open in a twinkling.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Millie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can nail down
some pieces of board and mother can step
right in. She won&#8217;t need any ladder. We
can change things around, too, and bring the
parlor up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Millie, &#8220;but it isn&#8217;t as
good as a door. I wouldn&#8217;t want to live in
a house that&#8217;s upside down, anyway. That
avenue won&#8217;t be anything but mud, till they
pave it and put in the sidewalks. I&#8217;m glad
we can&#8217;t be walled in or lose our doors and
windows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It changes everything for us,&#8221; said Rodney.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know what to make of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
it, yet, but I&#8217;ve loads of work to do, all day,
to have things right when mother comes
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I!&#8221; exclaimed Millie, and away
she went, downstairs, to go home across lots,
while he stepped out of the window and
turned to stare, in a puzzled way, at all of
his house that stuck up above the new
avenue. It certainly was not the same
house it had been, and all the ground around
it was walled in, but, after all, Rodney was
the same boy.</p>

<p>How about all those other boys, over on
Randall&#8217;s Island? They too were walled in,
but were they not the same boys? Did the
house they were in change them?</p>

<p>At all events, like Rodney, they had
&#8220;loads of work to do,&#8221; all day, until supper
time. Then indeed there was a curious kind
of coming in to supper, for this, too, was
part of their schooling and their discipline.</p>

<p>All over the enclosure and in every workshop,
could be heard the tap of a drum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Everywhere, work stopped. There were
minutes of preparation and of &#8220;putting
away things.&#8221; Then another drum-tap was
heard, and from all directions compact and
orderly squads of young fellows began to
march toward the great dining-room, supper-room,
of the House. Every boy was
&#8220;tallied,&#8221; on leaving his place of work, and
he was counted again as he went in to supper.
Every sentry on duty; every boy in
the &#8220;office&#8221;; promoted there for good behavior;
every inmate of the House was at
that hour reported and the Superintendent
knew where he was and what he was doing.</p>

<p>All but a very few of the boys were either
eating supper or taking their regular turns
as waiters, under the supervision of a blue-coated
gentleman who was all the while explaining
the supper management to half a
dozen visitors.</p>

<p>The supper was plentiful, of good quality,
well cooked, and there was absolute fairness
in the way it was served. There were many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
tables, each large enough for a dozen or so
of boys to sit around it comfortably, and
each table had its own boy watcher, a kind
of corporal, promoted to that post, temporarily,
for good conduct. There could be no
favoritism shown by the waiters, for among
them, to and fro, walked the regular officers
of the Institution. Anyhow, the supper of
those hundreds of young fellows, so many of
whom would otherwise have gone without
any supper, was worth anybody&#8217;s while to go
and see, for it suggested something that was
said, once: &#8220;I was hungry and ye fed
Me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hundreds of boys, and not a word from
one of them, even to his next neighbor, for
the rule of the place was that there should
be no talking at the table. Therefore, at all
of the many tables arranged around the
great dining hall, the most noticeable person
present was Silence.</p>

<p>So it was, although not so perfectly, at
Uncle John Bronson&#8217;s house, fifty miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
away, up the Hudson, but the silence was
broken there, at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;John!&#8221; exclaimed Aunt Betty. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
help thinking of Jim. I wish I knew what
he is doing and how they treat him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they treat him well enough,&#8221; he
responded, grimly. &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t do any
good for us to talk about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I s&#8217;pose it doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But
it seems as if he had lost everything. When
a boy is sent to such a place, you take away
from him all he has&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;They
say it&#8217;s a good place. Besides, he did it,
himself, when he stole the money. He&#8217;d
always been kind o&#8217; reckless and self-willed.
I guess he&#8217;ll learn something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When a boy loses his good name, and his
self-respect, and his liberty,&#8221; slowly replied
Aunt Betty, looking sorrowfully through the
window near her, &#8220;I think he loses about
everything there is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle John may have acted from what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
thought was a sense of duty, in something
he had done concerning Jim, but he looked
very uncomfortable, just now. He sat there,
with a face that grew redder and redder, all
the while Aunt Betty was gone into the
kitchen, after the teapot and the other
things that belonged to the farmhouse supper-table.
It might have been better for
them both if Jim had been there, instead of
at one of the tables in the House of Refuge.</p>

<small>EVENING VISITORS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Rodney</span> had said enough to Millie to make
it plain that his mother was accustomed to
go out to work and that she earned barely
enough for them to live on. He may have
been thinking of that, now, as he stared at
his house.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big avenue,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but mother&#8217;s
got to sell one of our lots to pay off the taxes
and assessments for having it done. I don&#8217;t
care if the city does pay for What land they
take. It&#8217;s hard on mother.&mdash;She&#8217;ll be awful
tired, but supper&#8217;s ready. Good one, too.
Don&#8217;t I Wish I could find something to do,
now I&#8217;m out of school? I&#8217;ve tried in dozens
of places. Guess there are too many boys.&mdash;Hullo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me b&#8217;ye,&#8221; came at that moment in a deep,
good-humored voice, behind him, &#8220;what ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
want is a dure, where the small windy is. I
can put wan in, chape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we want, Pat,&#8221; said Rodney.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dure was in a building we tore
down,&#8221; said Pat, &#8220;and it&#8217;s a good big wan.
All it wants is puttin&#8217; in, and a dure step to
the walk, wid a good rail, and ye&#8217;ll be as
well aff as iver ye was, wid a foine front on
the aveny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell mother,&#8221; said Rodney, with a
keen and hopeful survey of the place where
the door was to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twon&#8217;t cost her much,&#8221; added Pat,
&#8220;and the likes of her don&#8217;t want to be
climbin&#8217; in and out o&#8217; windies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away he went and Rodney was still considering
the matter when he was again
spoken to.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Rodney! This is dreadful! Seems
to me as if they were taking away everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; exclaimed Rodney. &#8220;We&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
have a door, there, instead of a window&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
and he rapidly explained Pat&#8217;s offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him to go ahead!&#8221; said Mrs. Nelson.
&#8220;No matter what it is, so long as it&#8217;s a door.
But somebody&#8217;s neck&#8217;ll be broken, yet, tumbling
down that wall, into our garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said that as she was getting in at the
window, after Rodney had taken away a
bundle she had carried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it downstairs,&#8221; he said, as he
followed her. &#8220;The parlor&#8217;s got to come
up here, but we can leave the dining-room
where it is, and the kitchen. Billy&#8217;s been
walking around, all day, at the foot of the
wall, trying to find a place to climb out, but
there isn&#8217;t any.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that very moment, a bearded, contented
looking face, appeared at the bay window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ba-a-beh!&#8221; it remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; exclaimed Rodney. &#8220;How
on earth did that fellow get out? Even a
goat can&#8217;t climb up and down a wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care how he got out,&#8221; she replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
wearily. &#8220;I must have my supper.&mdash;O,
dear! What are we to do! I feel clean
discouraged.&#8221;</p>

<p>Downstairs they went and both of them
seemed to be carrying heavier burdens than
the bundle, whatever it was. Rodney had
evidently been both housekeeper and cook
and a little table was set in the kitchen, handy
to the stove and the teapot, but Mrs. Nelson
walked straight on and out at the back door.</p>

<p>&#8220;How high those walls are!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Yes, I suppose the Kirbys would let us get
out through their place, but I&#8217;d rather have
a door of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I,&#8221; said Rodney. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell
Pat to go ahead and put one in, as soon as I
can see him, to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ba-a-beh!&#8221; came, just then, in a tone of
strong approval, from a friend whose left
horn was almost under Rodney&#8217;s elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, mother,&#8221; exclaimed Rodney, &#8220;how
did he get down here again. Guess there&#8217;s
a weak spot in that wall, somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>That might be, but Mrs. Nelson was too
tired to be interested in goats and walls, and
she went into the house. It was a great
mystery to her son, however, for he had inspected
the entire enclosure, that day, accompanied
by Billy, and had decided that
no fellow could get out unless he used a
ladder.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s about the smartest goat there is,&#8221;
remarked Rodney, &#8220;but I&#8217;d better watch him
and see how he does it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Supper time came and went, everywhere,
and after that the evening shadows began to
settle down over the city. Then anybody
looking in that direction from a distance
would have seen a kind of glow in the sky
above it, coming up from all the lights that
were burning along all the hundreds of
streets. There was no moon to speak of but
there were lights, in front windows of
dwellings and business places, and the stars
helped also, so that it seemed a pleasant
kind of evening.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>There was one street, on the eastern side
of the city, which projected nearly a hundred
feet out into the East River in the form
of a wooden pier. Only one solitary street-lamp
was burning on the pier and beyond it
all was a gloomy glimmer of rippling, rushing
water. A swift tide was rushing out and a
brisk wind was blowing.</p>

<p>The one lamp was on the left side of the
pier, at the head of a flight of wooden steps,
leading down to a float, and by the float was
moored a small but serviceable steam tugboat.
In that light, all that could be seen of
her was a stumpy, sheetiron engine chimney;
a lot of small windows, lighted up inside;
some steam from a puffing pipe; and the
rest of the boat had to be taken for granted.
There were puffs and coughs of steam because
the boat was at that moment casting
loose her hawser and setting out upon a
voyage.</p>

<p>She did not go directly across, but in a
slanting, southerly course, out of which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was quickly compelled to veer, yet more to
starboard, that is, to her right, by a vast
blaze of glitter and puff and a warning hoot
of a steam whistle which came swiftly up
from the southward. The glittering ranges
of windows and the two huge, black pipes
that towered above them, belonged to one of
the largest &#8220;Sound Steamers.&#8221; She was so
large, indeed, that when the tug had passed
her and steered into her wake, the swell it
was rocked in called out an exclamation of:</p>

<p>&#8220;O!&mdash;Well!&mdash;I declare!&#8221; from one of two
gentlemen who were sitting in the little cabin.</p>

<p>The next words he uttered, as he once
more squared himself in the seat he had been
so suddenly pitched out of, were:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a swell!&mdash;But what I was saying
about Jim is this:&mdash;He isn&#8217;t so bad a
boy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not bad at all, I think,&#8221; said the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;But then I can&#8217;t get at him. I&#8217;ve tried
again and again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I. He&#8217;s a complete puzzle.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>&#8220;And he isn&#8217;t sullen, either, and he isn&#8217;t
exactly rebellious, but you can&#8217;t make any
impression on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says he was unjustly convicted and
it works on him worse and worse, all the
time. We can&#8217;t help it, though&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we can&#8217;t, but I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;ll
hurt him, all his life&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure it will, but we must do our
duty. Some of the boys are turning out
splendidly. I&#8217;ve been hearing good news
from several of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I, but I don&#8217;t mean to give up
Jim. There&#8217;s the making of a man in that
boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is doing well in the school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the best type-setter in the printing
office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish he was out. There are a dozen
more that ought never to have been sent
there. I don&#8217;t mean that none of them did
wrong, but it hurts some boys, worse than
others, to be shut up. They feel a sting&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>&#8220;Here we are&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>They had talked pretty steadily all the
way, but the tug was now at her wharf on
Randall&#8217;s Island, and these were two of the
managers of the Society for the Reformation
of Juvenile Delinquents. The boys were &#8220;in
prison and they visited them.&#8221; They were
men of wealth, education, unusual intelligence.
There were others like them who
came and worked as they did, and it was
curious how strong a hold the youngsters
seemed to have upon them. Of course the
boys liked their friendly, sympathizing visitors,
but probably none of them ever knew,
at least while on the Island, what a study
and worry they were to such men as these,
as well as to the exceedingly capable and
faithful officers who were all the while in
charge of them. Many learned more after
going out into the world and finding that
even then these friends of theirs did not let
go of them but followed them with help and
hope and sympathy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>So this great school, with its high, stone
walls and its rigid discipline and its likeness
to a prison, was after all a splendid token of
the love that goes out after even the very
bad boys whom some people are willing to
give up and to throw away. The other name
of that Love is very sacred and beautiful.</p>

<p>Jim was not a bad boy, but he felt like
one, that night. He felt bad, all over, and
angry, and rebellious, and almost hopeless,
for he was all the while thinking of the wall
and of how high it was, and of all the great
world of life and liberty that lay beyond it.</p>

<p>So far as he could see, there were to be
long years of House of Refuge life, during
which he was to know little and see nothing
at all of that wide, bright world, and the
thought was very terrible. He thought a
great deal and imagined a great deal, but not
among any of his imaginings did there come
any idea that he had an interest in another
boy, over in New York City,&mdash;a boy whose
house and garden had been walled in by new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
streets. Jim knew nothing of Rodney; nor
of his mother; nor of Billy the goat; nor of
Millie Kirby. He could not have guessed
that they were ever to be of any importance
to him, over on the Island, listening and
waiting for the rap of the drum that was
shortly to tell him and all the rest that it was
bedtime.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV<br />

<small>BEHIND BOLTS AND BARS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Bedtime</span> at the House of Refuge was
quite an affair. Wherever there might be a
squad of boys, in any part of the buildings
or grounds, at the tap of the drum, they were
expected to &#8220;fall in,&#8221; like soldiers, and
march toward the dormitory. Each detachment
was sure to have its own officer, a boy
promoted, for good behavior and trustworthiness,
to be corporal, sergeant, or lieutenant.</p>

<p>The dormitory itself was a remarkable
sleeping place. It contained a separate room
for each boy, but the rooms were not arranged
like those of a hotel or a dwelling. There
was one immense room, with plenty of windows
for daylight and plenty of burners for
gaslight. All around the sides of this room
ran a broad, empty space, or passage-way,
and inside of this, up and down the middle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
had been constructed two tiers, one above
another, of little bedrooms. Each tier was
composed of two rows of rooms, set back to
back with their faces toward the outer windows.
The face or front of each room was
made of slender, upright steel bars, not much
more than two inches apart, and each room
had a door, made in the same way, shutting
with a strong, spring lock. Of course, each
room was small and the beds were only wide
enough for one boy, but they were very clean
and comfortable. There was plenty of light
when light was needed; plenty of air, always;
and then perfect silence to sleep
soundly in was secured by the rule which
forbade talking or any kind of skylarking in
the dormitory.</p>

<p>Watchmen patrolling around the upper or
lower tier of cells, or rooms, could at any
time see the entire inside of each, as they
walked by. The outer doors of the dormitory
closed with strong and intricate locks,
of a peculiar pattern. Beyond these were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
other doors, with watchmen, and beyond all
was the open parade-ground inclosure and
its high stone wall. Beyond this was the
chilling, rushing, impassable tide of the deep
and pitiless East River. No boy could hope
to get out from one of those sleeping cells
and into the city,&mdash;into liberty and the world
until the appointed time should come for
him.</p>

<p>The dormitory was as still as still could be,
that night, when Jim lay upon his bed and
thought of it all, and he grew bitter at heart
with the seeming impossibility of even getting
a chance to try Whether or not he could
climb the outer wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m about the best climber on the training
ship, when they send us into the rigging,&#8221; he
said to himself. &#8220;I could go up on a rope
or anything. If I could have some of the
other fellows with me! Some things I guess
I couldn&#8217;t do alone. I don&#8217;t want any but
plucky fellows and good climbers. I don&#8217;t
belong here. I never did it and I&#8217;ve been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
here long enough. I&#8217;m going to get out, if
I can.&mdash;There, he&#8217;s just gone by.&#8221;</p>

<p>That meant the passage of a watchman,
on his patrol, and Jim obeyed a strong,
angry impulse, to jump out of bed and stare
after him through the grated door of his
cage.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just like what they put wild animals
in, in a menagerie,&#8221; he thought, fiercely, as
his fingers griped the slim, but strong steel
rods.</p>

<p>O!&mdash;How he wanted to break out! He
drew back, a moment, and then he threw
himself, with all his might, against the grating.</p>

<p>He did not care if it hurt him. He was
so sore inside that it almost felt good to be
pained a little, outside.</p>

<p>Click!</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&mdash;What?&mdash;The door is
open?&mdash;What have I done?&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t have
broken it!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was so. Every rod in the grating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
near him and in the door, was perfectly
sound and whole, and yet,&mdash;he could hardly
believe his eyes,&mdash;the door of his cage was
now standing ajar, as if inviting him to push
it open wider and walk out into the roomy
corridor. He did so, but it was very much
as if it were all a dream.</p>

<p>Jim&#8217;s first feeling was a strong sense of
exhilaration, for one of the barriers he had
been thinking of had unexpectedly given
way. It was such a strong barrier, too, with
its steel gratings and its lock. He turned
and stared at his open door and empty
bedroom and he came near exclaiming
aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew the door had been shut as carefully
as usual by the officer who had been in
charge of the boys when they marched into
the dormitory.</p>

<p>He examined the look.</p>

<p>It was a very pretty, very perfect lock,
but he saw that its strong, brass tongue, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
played back and forth on its spring when a
key worked it, could also be pushed back by
his finger, pressing on its end. Then he
almost shut the door and could see that the
brass tongue was short and would only go
under its catch, on the upright at the side,
about half an inch or so.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; exclaimed Jim. &#8220;I can see,
now. When I pushed so hard, I bent the
grating, for those light steel bars are springy.
They sprung out so far that they pulled out
that tongue beyond the catch and so the
door slipped open. I can do it again,&mdash;Why,&mdash;I
can get out into the corridor as often as
I want to, but I mustn&#8217;t let anybody know
how it&#8217;s done. Not even the other fellows.&mdash;I&#8217;ll
look at their locks.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to him as if his very breathing
could be heard by somebody, and so he
hardly breathed as he stepped softly along to
the next door. The gas-jet near him had
been turned low and the light was dim, but
he could see that the boy in that cell was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sleeping soundly, after his hard work in one
of the shops and his long drill-marching.</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t one of the fellows I want,&#8221;
thought Jim. &#8220;He can&#8217;t climb worth a
cent and he hollers when he&#8217;s hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>That would never do, for Jim was beginning
to feel like a captain, hunting up recruits
for some difficult and almost desperate
enterprise. Nevertheless, he tried the
lock of that boy&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;they are all
alike. I can get my finger in over the end of
the catch-bolt and push it back.&mdash;There,
I&#8217;ve opened that door, but I&#8217;ll shut it again.
Guess I&#8217;ll go back to bed, too, before anybody
comes to catch me. I know I can open
the doors, but what good&#8217;ll that do? I&#8217;ve
got to think about it.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_048_fp.jpg" alt="The Silent Printing Office" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Silent Printing Office.</span></p>

<p>Silently, with his heart beating hard and
his breath coming short, Jim slipped back to
his own door, and through it, and pulled it
shut behind him. He made no noise in doing
so,&mdash;only a slight click as the bolt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
sprang into the hasp,&mdash;but he did not feel
safe until the bedclothes were over him
and he could seem to be asleep. Not many
minutes passed before he heard the feet of
another watchman, or it may have been the
same man,&mdash;going along the corridor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have been caught,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I
must look out for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>During all those minutes, and long afterward,
he lay and thought of locks, locks,
locks, on all the doors he knew of in that
House of Refuge. He made up his mind to
examine them, every chance he could get,
and he thought of all sorts of impossible ways
of opening them.</p>

<p>It was more and more like a dream until
his eyes closed and he was asleep, and he
slipped at once into a real dream of having
passed all the locked doors, only to find himself
standing in front of a stone wall twenty
feet high.</p>

<p>Away over in one of the northern wards
of the city of New York, Rod Nelson, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
sound asleep as Jim, was also dreaming and
he too had a stone wall to dream of. He
was not trying to climb it himself, however,
for he was only looking on while his bearded
friend Billy walked up the side of that wall
into the avenue, remarking, triumphantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ba-a-a-beh!&#8221;</p>

<p>When morning came, the usual round of
activities began, everywhere. The boys in
the House of Refuge dormitory dressed
themselves in their rooms. Then, as the
Superintendent&#8217;s assistant came and let
them out, they all marched away to breakfast.
Jim went with the rest, but he gave a
keen, inquiring side-glance, at the lock of
every door they passed. He thought he saw
something worth remembering in the lock of
the great, outer door of the dormitory itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;He only turned his key in it once,&#8221; he
said to himself. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen them turn it away
around three times. What does that mean?
I don&#8217;t know much about locks. They say
these are the best and safest kind, though.&#8221;</p>

<small>JIM&#8217;S PLOT FOR LIBERTY</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Women,</span> like Mrs. Nelson, who go out to
work for other people, have to get up early,
but her first thought, and Rodney&#8217;s, was
more about the door she was to go out by
than even about breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going right off to find Pat,&#8221; said
Rodney, as he helped her through the upper
side-window.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, before setting out on that
errand, he went down into the garden and
took a long look at all the land which had
been walled in. It might be as good as ever,
for a garden, but it had a queer, shut-up appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Billy?&#8221; he inquired, aloud.
&#8220;Hullo. There he is, out on the avenue.
How did the old rascal foot it up that
wall?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>There was Billy, indeed, with his toes on
the very edge, and with a wisp of something
green sticking out at one side of his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Greens!&#8221; exclaimed Rodney. &#8220;He can
steal from a grocer&#8217;s wagon better than any
other goat I know of.&mdash;We used to have a
garden. Tell you what, we can make garden
of our lots and all the others, too, if we can
only have it ploughed. But how would a
horse and plough ever get down here?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a pretty deep question and he gave
it up, for that time. In a minute more he
was upstairs and out through the window, on
his errand to Pat. So far as he knew, he
left the house without a living soul in it, but
before he reached the next corner, the door
of the little back bedroom, at the head of
the stairs, went to with a sharp slam. It
must have been a strong draft of air that did
it, or else the door shut itself.</p>

<p>Pat was found and a bargain was made
but Rodney did not see the new door. That
is, the old door that was to take the place of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the window. In fact, he felt like being satisfied
with almost anything.</p>

<p>When he reached home again, he closed
the window carefully behind him and went
down and out for another look around at his
vacant land. Hardly was he beyond the
back doorstep, however, before he was
hailed with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney!&mdash;Do look up there!&mdash;Doesn&#8217;t
he look funny! How did he ever manage to
get there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why!&mdash;Millie!&#8221; exclaimed Rodney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ba-a-a-beh!&#8221; came almost piteously
down from the upper back window, on the
left. It Was Rodney&#8217;s own room and the
window had been left open, to air it, and
there was Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care so much how he got in,&#8221;
said Rodney, &#8220;but there he is and we must
get him out, somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that very hour, the breakfast room at
the House of Refuge was full of hungry
boys but it was wonderfully quiet. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was a slight rattle of crockery, and now and
then a low-spoken word from one of the
officers, but the eyes of those watchful
guardians were everywhere and the rules of
order were thoroughly enforced. Beyond a
doubt, this also was a valuable part of the
schooling the boys were getting but it was a
kind of restraint and was in danger of being
mistaken for oppression. It is one of the
traditions of the House that all of the half-way
rebellions among the young fellows have
broken out in the dining-room or in the
schoolroom, where the discipline is so complete,
and never in any manner out of doors,
no matter how severe might be the drill of
the parade-ground.</p>

<p>Jim, at his own table, was willing enough
to be silent, then and there, but he was
ready to burst with his great secret and was
anxious to find somebody, the right boy, to
tell it to. He thought them over, one by
one, for he knew them all, but it was not
easy to decide among them. He was compelled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
at all events, to wait for a proper opportunity,
and that could not come for hours,
yet. His next experiences must necessarily
come to him at his type-setting work, at his
&#8220;case&#8221; in the printing room.</p>

<p>This was a light and pleasant place to be
in. It had altogether an air of regular business
and not at all of restriction, unless it
might be in the clock work precision of
whatever was going on and in the fact that
there was no talking, no communication,
among the many busy &#8220;typos.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim had a slip of printed &#8220;copy&#8221; put before
him, on his case, and the moment he saw
it he remarked to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Star Spangled Banner?&mdash;If I haven&#8217;t had
to set that up four times! I know where
that comes from. The Superintendent is always
telling us we are Americans. Going
to be citizens. So is the Military Instructor.
They&#8217;re both naval officers&mdash;I&#8217;m an American,
but loads of the other fellows are not.
It&#8217;s my flag&mdash;I&#8217;ll set it up&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>There was something in it. A great deal
more teaching than he or any of the others
knew was in the flag, the starry flag of freedom,
that was carried at the head of the
parade-ground battalion; that was displayed
in the larger rooms of the House; that hung
over the principal&#8217;s platform in the schoolroom;
and that so finely ornamented the
handsome lecture room in the main building.
It had something to do with the other
teachings and with some of the traditions
that passed around among the boys. How
some had gone out from that place to be
sailors in the navy; others to be soldiers and
even officers in the army; and how that and
everything else, to them and all other boys,
depended on good behavior.</p>

<p>Jim was thinking about it, now, but his
uppermost thought was that sailors went all
over the world, into far off seas, into foreign
lands, in freedom; and that soldiers, especially
cavalry soldiers, rode across the plains
and among the mountains, seeing and doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
wonderful things, in freedom. O, how he
longed for something wild and dashing and
adventurous,&mdash;something like the very dash
for freedom that he was even now looking
forward to and trying to plan!</p>

<p>He naturally supposed that his undertaking,
if he should make it, would have to do
with the various kinds of persons near him,
and would as soon have thought of China, as
of a boy and girl who were looking at a
goat, in a second story window, over in the
city. He was not in their thoughts either,
and Millie&#8217;s next remark was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother says you can go through our
house as much as you want to. She won&#8217;t
look the back door&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come right over and see her, soon as
I&#8217;ve got Billy down,&#8221; said Rodney. &#8220;I want
to find out how he got into my room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait,&#8221; said Millie. &#8220;Mother said she
wanted to see you&mdash;&#8221; but he had already
darted into the house.</p>

<p>In a moment more the door of his bedroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
was opened and out sprang Billy. Without
stopping to explain how he got in, or in what
freak of goat-mind he butted that door shut,
he showed Rod that he could at least go
downstairs. Rod followed him out and Millie
shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;There he goes!&mdash;Now you come right
along with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was a short, thin, dark haired girl,
with eyes and a face that seemed all one
flush and sparkle of go and energy. Her
very voice had in it something peremptory
and Rod stepped off as obediently as if she
had been a school-teacher. He knew the
way through the gap in the fence and through
the Kirby back-yard, and he knew that they
had a hall running through the house to the
street door. That opened on an old avenue
that was all built up and almost all the lower
stories of the houses were used for business
purposes. Mr. Kirby was a printer and his
ground floor was his shop, with a steam
engine in the rear room. There were two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
stories above for the family to live in and
the hall went all the way through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you ever so much,&#8221; said Rodney
to Mrs. Kirby, when she came downstairs,
&#8220;but we&#8217;re going to have a door put
in and then we won&#8217;t have to climb through
the window&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can use our hall till then,&#8221; said Mrs.
Kirby, with a voice and manner precisely
like Millie&#8217;s, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t have you bringing
any other boys to tramp through. Mr.
Kirby&#8217;s workmen are bad enough&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Something else called her and she was
gone before Rodney could think what to say
to her, but she had used one word that fitted
closely to all he had been thinking about
while he was looking at the walls and the
land and the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Workmen?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Tell you what,
Millie, don&#8217;t I wish I had a trade! I&#8217;m
afraid I ain&#8217;t going to get one. They say
there isn&#8217;t any chance for boys, nowadays&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>&#8220;I can set type,&#8221; said Millie, &#8220;when
there&#8217;s any to set, but father says it&#8217;s awful
dull times. I want to do something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to!&#8221; exclaimed Rodney.
&#8220;You see if I don&#8217;t. I won&#8217;t let my mother
work to support me. I&#8217;m going to get out,
somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he too had a feeling that he was somehow
penned in. Circumstances were against
him and he must climb over them or get
around them. Billy the goat had somehow
or other circumvented the walls created by
the streets and avenues. What a goat could
do, a boy could do, but then Rodney did not
as yet quite understand how Billy had managed
to perform his feat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI<br />

<small>PLANS FOR ACTION</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Different</span> people have different kinds of
difficulties to overcome. Rodney Nelson,
over in the city, felt as if he were shut up
from doing anything better than the work of
changing his mother&#8217;s furniture from one
room to another. He had no trade; nothing
that he could earn money with; no prospects
for the future. Jim, setting up type at his
case in the printing office of the House of
Refuge, felt almost as if he had no hope
whatever. He had a new experience before
him, however, and it began to come soon
after he got out upon the parade-ground. It
was not yet time for the afternoon drill and
all the boys were at liberty to do as they
pleased. Some of them were playing ball;
some were at leap-frog; some were simply
skylarking, as they called it, and that meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
all sorts of rough fun. It was Jim&#8217;s time for
selecting the boys to whom he could tell his
secret and get them to join him in whatever
he was going to do. He was just going to
speak to one boy, when something came into
his mind that made him stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I guess I won&#8217;t tell him,&#8221; he said to
himself. &#8220;I don&#8217;t belong here, but he does.
I couldn&#8217;t look the Superintendent in the
face if I should let that fellow out. It&#8217;s the
best place for him. He didn&#8217;t know a thing
when he came here. Now he can read and
write and make shoes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then one of the officers passed him,
with a nod and a smile, and Jim could smile
back, as he touched his hat, for he had less
of a sort of guilty feeling which had troubled
him. He turned and looked at the great
crowd of boys, scattered over the enclosure,
and his thought took a wider form.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em all out!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Why,
it would be the worst thing in the world for
most of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>That did not change his idea concerning
himself and he may not have been a good
judge of what was best for others, for, before
the afternoon was over there were four boys
besides himself who knew about the dormitory
door-locks.</p>

<p>&#8220;If yours won&#8217;t spring open, mine will,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Just you wait, anyhow, till I
come and let you out.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were excited enough about it, but
each boy of them seemed to feel, as strongly
as he did, that it would be doing the hundreds
of others hurt instead of good to let
them out of that place.</p>

<p>The Superintendent and the Managers
might even have been gratified if they could
have known how clear was the opinion expressed
that they were &#8220;doing first-rate&#8221;
with the youngsters under their charge.</p>

<p>That was not the only matter that Jim had
to study, during that very long day. He
believed that he knew every stone in the
parade-ground wall, already, and now he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
found himself studying the buildings also,
and wondering how he should ever manage
to lead a squad of escaping boys right
through them. Getting out of a bedroom
was only a kind of beginning, after all, and
Jim&#8217;s heart sank within him, for he thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;They are stronger than the wall is, and
beyond them is the East River.&mdash;I don&#8217;t
care! It&#8217;s just the awfullest kind of thing
to do, but I&#8217;m going to do it, somehow!&#8221;</p>

<p>No point or place in all the barriers of the
House of Refuge seemed to promise a door
through which he could get out.</p>

<p>That very evening, over in their house,
Rodney and his mother were also discussing
the door question, but they were also wondering
over the fact that Billy the goat had
evidently found one, for that remarkable
animal was again missing.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can stay outside, too,&#8221; said Rodney,
&#8220;if we&#8217;re going to have a garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d eat up everything we planted,&#8221; remarked
Mrs. Nelson. &#8220;We&#8217;ve three whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
lots of our own, and we can garden all the
rest till they build on them. That won&#8217;t be
for ever so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about all I can do,&#8221; said Rodney, and
he seemed to have a hopeless feeling about it
and he went to bed thinking:</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s anything that just tires a fellow
out, it&#8217;s having nothing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim, on the other hand, marched into the
dormitory, with the rest, feeling tired all
over because he had something to do and
did not yet know how to do it. He lay
awake a long time, listening to the faint
sounds which now and then disturbed the
silence. No kind of rules could prevent
some stirring until all the boys were asleep,
but one sound that Jim waited for was that
of the feet of the watchman, patrolling the
corridor. He heard it come and go, more
than once, before he cautiously arose and
went to his steel-barred gate.</p>

<p>He had been studying that matter and he
did not bang himself against it, this time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
He folded his coverlet and poked it in among
the middle bars, so that it covered three of
them. Then he put on his stockings and
his shoes, pulled his bedstead nearer, lay
down on his back and drove both feet
against the padded spot, with all his might.
The coverlet had prevented any noise, but
he had to try again and again.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he whispered, at last. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
done it! The door&#8217;s open!&#8221;</p>

<p>Off came his shoes and in an instant he
was out in the corridor, but there he paused,
for a strange, guilty feeling came over him.
He almost felt as if he were stealing something.
He did not quite understand it, but
he mustered all his resolution and went on.
In less than three minutes he had his four
friends, in their stocking feet, out of their
cells.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;All we can
do, to-night, is to find out how.&#8221;</p>

<p>They only dared to nod at him, in reply,
as they followed him to the large door, leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
out of the dormitory. It was not grated
but made solidly, of wood, and it had a stern,
forbidding look. Jim leaned forward and
felt of the lock.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hush&mdash;sh!&mdash;They
only turned the key once, when they locked
it. If they&#8217;d turned it twice I couldn&#8217;t have
opened it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly, heavily, reluctantly, the massive
door came open, as he pulled, and he could
peep out. O, how his heart was beating!
The other boys stood and watched him as if
he were a kind of hero, but he suddenly
closed the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got to wait for some night when the watchman&#8217;s
asleep. Get back to bed!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a swift flitting along the corridor,
a careful pulling to of five grated doors,
and the patrol who went by them a minute
or so later discovered no sign of anything
unusual.</p>

<p>Jim lay awake for a while. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
glow of exultation all over him, for he felt
that he had gained one point now. Then
he thought of the great world of freedom he
hoped to escape into.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spring is here,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Pretty
soon things&#8217;ll be green and growing. I want
to go up and see our place, but I won&#8217;t go
in. I want to see Aunt Betty, but I don&#8217;t
want to see Uncle John. He&#8217;d say I did
wrong to get out. I don&#8217;t believe she would.
There&#8217;s a farm here and lots o&#8217; greenhouses,
but only a few boys can work in them. I
mean to be out in the country when summer
comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Between him and the country, however,
lay the great city, and between Randall&#8217;s
Island and that ran the deep, swift tides of
the East River. It made him shiver to think
of that, but he could see, in his mind&#8217;s eye,
not only the river, with the wharves and
buildings on the opposite side, but the one
little wharf on this side, where the little tug
that belonged to the House of Refuge was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
sure to be moored, each night, after all its
trips to and fro were ended. He knew she
was there, now, a tight little craft, mostly
chimney and cabin, and just then he suddenly
sat up in bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; he said, almost aloud. &#8220;I
remember! There&#8217;s a little lifeboat on top,&mdash;on
the roof deck. If we could get her!
There might be a watchman on the wharf.&mdash;There
might not.&mdash;I guess we could get her
into the water. O!&#8221;</p>

<p>There seemed to be really less water in
the East River, now he had thought of that
boat, but he sank back on his pillow and
went to sleep while he went over and over
the obstacles that lay between him and the
wharf where the tug was moored. His boy
associates, curiously enough, were long since
sleeping soundly, as if they had been contented
to leave all the required thinking and
all the anxiety to their busy minded and
daring young captain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII<br />

<small>ONE PLAN THAT FAILED</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> hours were the rule of the dormitory,
but general conversation could not begin
at once on getting up. Jim did not feel
like speaking to anybody. His first strong
impression was that any officer who looked
him in the face might see there that something
was going on. His next, as he met his
confederates, one by one, was that he could
see by their faces that they were trying to
keep a secret.</p>

<p>After that, he was little surprised to find
himself making the same remark concerning
some of the smaller boys. He thought no
more about that, for they were very apt to
get into scrapes, but they did indeed have
something on their minds, every inch as
heavy, for them, as was the load he carried
himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>He had already learned over again one
thing that he had known before. This was
that all his hopes and plans must wait
awhile. He would have to go along and let
things turn up, one after another. Nobody
can ever tell what is coming next or how
their plans will unexpectedly run into those
of other people.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson and Rodney, for instance,
could hardly say that they had any plans,
beyond hoping to sell one of their town lots
for enough to pay the taxes and assessments
on the rest; and having a door put in; and
having a garden. She could not afford to
keep Rodney any longer at school. He was
old enough to earn something, and, besides,
what if she should get sick or be out of
work?</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to do something,&#8221; he said, as he
was carrying a chair upstairs. &#8220;Millie Kirby
can set type. I wish I could. But she
learned how in her father&#8217;s shop.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was a stirring kind of girl, anyhow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and he was a little afraid of her, but when he
came downstairs again, she was in the back
doorway, calling out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney! Rodney!&mdash;You must come over
to our house, right away! Billy&#8217;s down in
our cellar and we can&#8217;t get him out. He&#8217;s
drank up all the milk and he&#8217;s eaten all the
vegetables. He tried to butt me and mother,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did he get there!&#8221; exclaimed
Rodney, setting out at once. &#8220;The old
rascal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cellar was shut up, all night,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and the things were put into it to
keep them safe, and when we went down, this
morning, there was Billy, ready to fight us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the worst old goat!&#8221; said Rodney,
&#8220;and he doesn&#8217;t belong to me, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went in a hurry, however, and in a few
minutes he began to understand the matter.
The cellar stairs went down from a door
opening into the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was open when you and I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
through, yesterday,&#8221; said Rodney to Millie.
&#8220;He just followed us. Why, it&#8217;s through
this hall he gets out into the street, sometimes.
He watches till the door&#8217;s open. I
guess he got into my room through that
front window.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was not all, if Rodney had but
known the working of the mind of a goat.
Having once gone downstairs successfully,
in his own house, the next time he saw stairs
before him, they seemed to promise to let
him out into liberty, and so he was now
down in the Kirby cellar, a very much bewildered
goat. His plans had all gone
wrong and he was glad to have his own best
friend take him by the horns and lead him
upstairs again.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he goes!&#8221; shouted Millie, but
Rodney was just then listening ruefully to
Mrs. Kirby&#8217;s energetic account of all the
robbery and other mischief Billy had accomplished
in her cellar.</p>

<p>He was glad enough to get away homeward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and carry an account of Billy&#8217;s transactions
to Pat the carpenter, up on the new
avenue.</p>

<p>&#8220;The baste!&#8221; exclaimed Patrick. &#8220;But
thim will climb anywhere.&mdash;Luk at that?
It&#8217;s a big hole for wan dure but it&#8217;s the
good job I&#8217;m makin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can paint it,&#8221; said Rod. &#8220;I guess I
can paint all the side of the house. &#8217;Twon&#8217;t
take much, all that&#8217;s above the street.&mdash;Then
if I could get the garden ploughed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; exclaimed Pat. &#8220;Sure, I
know a man wid a small horse and a plough
of his own. If Billy can come through
Kirby&#8217;s hall, why can&#8217;t a pony? I&#8217;ll see to
that same.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a ray of hope for Rod, although he
doubted if Mrs. Kirby would let a horse of
any kind go through her house. He said he
would see her about it, but what he really
meant was that he would speak to Millie.</p>

<p>That was a long day to quite a number of
people. Nowhere, however, was there more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of it than among some of the boys who
spent part of its afternoon in a long, hard
drill on the House of Refuge parade-ground.</p>

<p>Most of them marched pretty well, but
there were several middle-sized boys, in the
third company from the front, who had to
be spoken to, several times, for the way they
missed step.</p>

<p>Jim was not near enough to them, when
the line halted before the wall and faced
about, to notice how they craned their heads
around and stared at it. What could they
have been thinking about, in or on that gray,
stony face?</p>

<p>Jim himself had thought of it and had
studied it, and it seemed to him to be all the
while coming between him and the island
wharf. Still, he paid particular attention to
his orders and his marching, just as he had,
in the earlier part of the day, to his type-setting
tasks.</p>

<p>The close of the day came, at last, in a
dim, foggy kind of dusk that promised darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
much earlier than usual. The parade-ground,
and all the rest of the wide enclosure,
outside of the buildings, seemed to be
deserted. Inside of the buildings, however,
there suddenly arose a kind of buzz, that
quickly amounted to something like an excitement.
A rumor whispered its way
around among the boys that three of their
number were missing and could not be found.</p>

<p>They did not know that the first difficulty
which troubled their officers, just then, was
that there was not a sufficient number of
themselves for indoor duty and, at the same
time, to spare searchers for stray boys over
so large a space and in so many places.
Nearly a score of the older and more trustworthy
boys were therefore picked out as
helpers, and they were quickly scurrying
hither and thither, in all directions. Jim
felt especially gratified that the Assistant
Superintendent, a handsome young naval
officer whom he could not help liking, chose
him for one of the hunters. He knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
neither of the fellows were missing whom he
intended as the crew of his boat, and he
went out into the dim, gloomy parade-ground
with a perfect fever of curiosity to discover
what any other fellows were up to.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t get away,&#8221; he said to his
blue uniformed friend, &#8220;but what can they
be trying to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said the officer, &#8220;but we
can&#8217;t find a trace of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was indeed a pretty long time before
they did so. Every nook and cranny of the
shops and other buildings and of all the
walled-in ground had been gone over and it
was, fast getting into the shape of a mystery.</p>

<p>Jim was carrying a lantern, but the officer
held in his hand a different kind of light, a
reflector, a &#8220;bull&#8217;s-eye,&#8221; that would throw a
stream of light ahead like a small locomotive
headlight. He was busily throwing it in all
directions and just now, as if by mere accident,
he sent it up to the roof of the large
building next to the engine building. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
was not so very high, but was much higher
than the latter and it had several chimneys,
coming out just above its eaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; exclaimed Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they are!&#8221; said the officer, almost
laughing; and then he shouted, commandingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down, boys! We&#8217;ll put up a
ladder.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had not gone up there by a ladder,
but, with wonderful pluck and agility, by
way of the water-pipe at one end of the
building. They had then intended to have
remained hidden, each behind a chimney,
until all should be quiet within the enclosure.</p>

<p>After that they would have had to come
down into the parade-ground again and hunt
for some means of scaling the wall. As for
anything beyond that, when they came down
and were questioned, it seemed that all their
small plot went no further. They did not
know what they meant to do after getting
over the wall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>&#8220;They might have known they&#8217;d be missed,
right away,&#8221; thought Jim. &#8220;Glad they
didn&#8217;t fall and break their necks. Best thing
for &#8217;em that they got caught. But I&#8217;ve
learned one thing. That high building has
water pipes on this side but the engine
building hasn&#8217;t any. It&#8217;s a low building,
too. I wish there was some way for getting
on the roof of it and down the other side, but
there isn&#8217;t any.&#8221;</p>

<p>So there his own plan broke down again,
just as had the thoughtless undertaking of
smaller boys. Nevertheless, an hour or so
after they were all safely locked up in the
dormitory, he was out of his own cell and in
four others, one after another, telling his
friends he believed he had discovered a pathway
which might lead them all to the wharf
on the bank of the river.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII<br />

<small>NEW IDEAS THAT CAME</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not always pleasant to have to wait,
but there are a great many things to be
learned, sometimes, while one is waiting.</p>

<p>Jim was now studying the House of Refuge,
all over, all the while, and at first even
the officers seemed like a part of the barrier
he would have to break through in order to
get out. Then, as he thought of them, he
found himself wishing he could tell them he
was not intending to run away from them,
not at all, but only from the idea of being
shut up. He longed for freedom. The
House had been a sort of home, for a long
time, but he wanted to escape from its unchanging
routine of work and school and
drill, and firm, though kindly discipline. No
such thing was known there as corporal punishment,
but all the rules were rigidly enforced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and Jim wanted to get away from
them. Most of all, however, he wanted to
escape from the sting and shame of being in
prison, and from the injustice of being there
for something he did not do. More than
once he half wished he could explain himself
to one of the Managers, a gentleman who
used to come and sit down with the boys and
talk with them. They told that man everything,
somehow, as if he were an older
brother.</p>

<p>Not only Jim but his confederates grew a
little feverish, as the days went by. They
even ran risks of discovery, for night after
night they were out in the corridor, minutes
at a time, trying the lock of the great door
and peering furtively into the passage-way
beyond to see what the watchman was doing.
Jim knew more, now, about the tug and the
wharf, and he had had opportunities for examining
both sides of the engine house.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too high to climb,&#8221; he said, &#8220;unless
we can get something to climb with. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
never leave out a ladder, anywhere. It&#8217;s
nothing but walls, walls, walls!&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not solve that problem, yet, but
one of Rodney Nelson&#8217;s had been solved for
him. Mrs. Kirby had permitted Pat&#8217;s friend
to take his pony and plow through her hall,
and the garden had been thoroughly ploughed
and harrowed. Rodney was having plenty
of work, therefore, although he would rather
have been learning a trade. Most of the
ground was to be planted in potatoes, but
Millie Kirby told Rodney that if it were hers
she would make every inch of it grow something.</p>

<p>She was over there, at the house, one
evening, just after supper and they were all
out on the sidewalk, looking at the new door.
Billy the goat was standing with his forefeet
on the edge of the wall, near them, looking
down as if he were anxious to see his new
vegetables begin to come up in that garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Nelson,&#8221; came from behind them,
&#8220;I want to spake to ye about another job.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_082_fp.jpg" alt="They All Stood Still While The Drum Beat" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">They All Stood Still While The Drum Beat.</span></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&#8220;Pat,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but what a big door!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fine, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; replied Pat.
&#8220;Now he&#8217;s painted it green, with red siding,
and all the rest of the hoose white. It&#8217;s the
good painter he is, for a b&#8217;ye&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the doors big enough for the biggest
kind of house&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Millie.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Pat. &#8220;It kem out of an
owld grocery-sthore front. It&#8217;s a sthore dure
and not a hoose dure at all. What yez want,
Mrs. Nelson, is to put a sthore behind that
dure. The front room there is for that.
Sure, the big, bay windy is there to show
things in. Ye could sell all that comes from
the garden, and hooks and eyes, and tay and
coffee and sugar, and mebbe onything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, mother,&#8221; shouted Rodney, but
Pat had more to say and he went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;What yez want, now, is a counter and
some shelvin&#8217;, and a whole lot of thim was
thrown away from a place I know of, yisther-day.
It&#8217;ll all go in, there, aisy, and the b&#8217;ye
could paint it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&#8220;Fetch it right along,&#8221; said Rodney, and
his mother repeated it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fetch it along,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Why, we
could keep a thread-needle store, and no rent
to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come and &#8217;tend counter, too,&#8221; said
Millie: &#8220;while you&#8217;re out and Rodney&#8217;s at
work in the garden. Besides, he could carry
newspapers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go, now,&#8221; interrupted Pat, &#8220;but
I&#8217;ll do that, at wanst, and by-and-bye yez
can take out the middle partition, and have
the whole flure in wan, and there&#8217;s your big
sthore.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was off, leaving them to consider the
matter, but the next remark was from Billy
and it had a doubtful sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ba-a-ah-eh-beh!&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>The making of the new avenue and the
laying of its neat, stone sidewalk, went rapidly
on. It was already a thoroughfare, with
wagons and foot passengers using it all the
while. Only a few days later, Pat and Rodney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
spent an evening putting in the shelves
and the counters. They would look shabby
enough until they were painted, but there
was a kind of promise in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the fine sthore ye&#8217;ll have,&#8221; said Pat,
&#8220;and no trouble with ony landlord. Many&#8217;s
the sthore&#8217;d do well, if it wasn&#8217;t for havin&#8217;
rint to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be long before it pays us anything,
I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said Mrs. Nelson. &#8220;We mustn&#8217;t
wait till Rodney can gather potatoes from
that garden, though. I must see about getting
something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to do that, myself,&#8221; remarked
Rodney.</p>

<p>The bright, spring days were doing all
they could for the gardens in the city and
everywhere else, and there came one very
bright day to Randall&#8217;s Island. The very
water of the East River, on either side of the
island, seemed to dance in the sunlight, and
the mad rush of the tide through Little Hellgate
channel, between that and Ward&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Island, northerly, was all one glitter. The
great city of New York, over on Manhattan
Island, was looking its very best, but the
boys in the House of Refuge parade-ground
could not see it. They could see nothing
outside of their stone walled enclosure, but
one boy saw something inside of it, just after
the battalion broke ranks, which made him
stand still and almost turn pale. The drums
had ceased their beating, but his heart took
up the business and went on, beating hard,
for a full minute. He looked, he looked
again, he stared earnestly at the roof of the
engine house, and he exclaimed, aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&mdash;That&#8217;ll do!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he stooped and picked up a clutter
of rope that lay upon the ground and threw
it into a large, empty box, like a dry goods
case, which stood near the corner of the base
ball ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they won&#8217;t take it in,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and if they don&#8217;t, it&#8217;ll be there. I won&#8217;t
say anything to the boys, yet.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Precisely what he meant, he did not explain,
but there was a flush on his face and a
bright light in his eyes, all supper time.</p>

<p>Everything went on as usual, and in due
season the long column of gray uniformed
youngsters, larger and smaller, tramped into
the dormitory and they were toled off to their
sleeping cages. Not one was missing, for
those who were still detained outside, on
various duties, were all considered accounted
for.</p>

<p>Jim was not one of these, and all he
seemed to have to do was to get into bed and
go to sleep. He got into his bed, indeed, in
the most orderly way, but he did not go to
sleep. No boy could do more than shut his
eyes, by main force, when all the rest of him
was in such a tingle.</p>

<p>Jim had a curious sensation of feeling
very brave, himself, but of not being exactly
sure of the pluck and steadiness of his comrades
that were to be. His next idea was
that he had enough and to spare for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
whole party and that he could and would see
them through.</p>

<p>He was their captain and the whole responsibility
of success or failure rested upon
him. It grew heavier, too, during three
long hours that he deemed it well to wait,
before he arranged his bed-battering ram and
began to try his heels upon the springing
steel rods of his grating.</p>

<p>The door seemed to open harder than
usual, and he was afraid he was making a
noise that would be heard by the wrong persons,
but at that moment the lock-bolt
clicked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s open!&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;Now
for the big door, before I stir &#8217;em up. I
must see how things are.&#8221;</p>

<p>O, how carefully he fingered the lock of
that strong, wooden portal!</p>

<p>&#8220;They only turned it once!&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a slipping!&#8221;</p>

<p>It slipped silently back and he turned the
knob and pulled. Then, as he peered furtively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
out, he drew a very long breath and
wheeled around and darted along the corridor.</p>

<p>He opened one of the doors, but just behind
it stood a boy, fully dressed, with a pair
of shoes in one hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Murphy&#8217;s asleep! Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another door was visited and another boy
stepped forth to hear the same news, with
the order:</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow Joe! Wait at the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two more cages let out their actually
trembling boys, and now all five of them
stood in line at the main doorway.</p>

<p>Jim looked out and turned and raised his
hand. In a moment more, that door was
shut behind them and four of them had made
their silent, stocking-footed way, to another,
similar barrier, at the end of the hall. Their
captain was leaning over the slumbering
watchman, for in his relaxed hand, almost
let go of, was a bunch of keys, and to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
them away without waking him was a delicate
piece of work. It was more than that,
for Jim felt that it was something very like
stealing. He would not have had one of the
Managers see him do it for the world. He
felt mean, even after he got the keys, but he
seemed to get over it while he was opening
the outer door with one of them. Then the
hardest thing to do was to carry back the
Whole bunch and put it silently down by the
watchman, so that he need not miss them.</p>

<p>Jim did it, and he felt less like a thief
after giving back those keys, but in a half
minute more he and his friends were out on
the parade-ground, clustering close to the
shadowy wall of the engine house. They had
accomplished a great deal, but they had not
yet escaped, by any means.</p>

<small>GETTING OVER THE WALL</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were lights, here and there, in
some of the windows of the House of Refuge
buildings and there were others, like
street-lamps, outside, but all was silence.</p>

<p>The boys themselves had hardly dared to
whisper, but now one of them asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim, how are we to climb the wall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t climb it,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;See!
right here! Three empty boxes and a
board! We are going over the roof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t get down on the other
side,&#8221; whispered another boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we can,&#8221; replied Jim triumphantly,
as he held up a coil of small rope that he
pulled out of a box. &#8220;Wait and see. Let&#8217;s
pile up these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was easy work for five strong, active
boys, to put those boxes one on top of another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
but even then the board only reached
from the topmost box to a little above the
eaves of the building.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;soon as I&#8217;m up,
throw me the end of the rope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not many young fellows could have gone
up that board as he did, or, afterward, up
the steep, slippery slates of the roof, with a
coil of rope in one hand. It was first-rate
gymnastics, with a chance for a slide and a
heavy fall, but Jim reached the ridge, just as
one of his followers came up over the eaves,
after making several small failures to climb
the board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the rope,&#8221; said Jim, as he passed
it around a chimney that came up through
the ridge, tied it at the ends and threw the
loop down toward the head of the board.
He could hold it steady and it was all they
needed. Very quickly, all five were perched
in a row, like blackbirds on a fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s next?&#8221; they asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad we all had so much practice on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
training ship,&#8221; replied Jim. &#8220;It takes a
sailor to go down by a rope. This one&#8217;s long
enough to hang down, double, almost to the
ground. It won&#8217;t be much of a drop, then.
I&#8217;ll go first. Hold hard! Steady, now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even yet, he had not told them the whole
of his plan, but they were learning to trust
him and they were eager enough to do just
as he said.</p>

<p>On the whole, they had at least learned
soldierly obedience and good discipline in
the school they were escaping from.</p>

<p>Down went Jim, hand over hand, to the
eaves on the outer side of the engine house,
and then he disappeared. They had hardly
been able to see him, anyhow, and now they
waited, half shivering, till a warning tug at
the rope told them he had safely reached the
ground. He had really found little difficulty
in doing that and the hardest share really
fell upon the last boy of all, for it seemed to
him as if the other four had taken all night
for it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&#8220;Wait, now,&#8221; said Jim, as he untied the
ends of the rope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave it,&#8221; said one of the boys. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t want it any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; said Jim, as he drew
down the full length of the untied rope,
coiled it and made a hank of it. &#8220;If they
find it on the other side, they won&#8217;t know
how we got down.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw it with all his might; it cleared
the roof-ridge and down it slid into the
parade-ground to keep its own secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we going to do, now, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Follow me!&mdash;The
lifeboat on the tug!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just want to yell!&#8221; exclaimed the boy
he had called Joe. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to beat
&#8217;em, this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad it&#8217;s so dark,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
make a sound! Step carefully!&#8221;</p>

<p>Like so many young panthers, prowling in
the woods, they went forward, a step at a
time, single file, until they had cleared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
corner of the main building and were in the
broad, well kept grounds between that and
the East River. Jim himself wanted to
shout when he saw the water and, far beyond
it, the glimmering midnight lamps of the
city.</p>

<p>There, only a short distance from them,
now, was the wharf at which the tug was
moored and over the wooden-railed walk
leading down to it was a bright gaslight
burning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down!&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;We must creep,
now. Not on all fours.&mdash;Creep!&#8221;</p>

<p>So they did, and a watchman who was patrolling
the entire front of the House did
not catch a glimpse of them. Head foremost,
they followed their leader, down the
wooden-railed companion way to the wharf.</p>

<p>&#8220;There might have been a man on guard
here,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;but there isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a light in the cabin of the tug
and another in the engine room, but no living
being was to be seen as they scurried up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the bit of ladder that took them to the upper
deck, the roof, of the tug, where the lifeboat
lay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, boys!&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Over with
her! There isn&#8217;t a minute to spare!&mdash;Don&#8217;t
you see? There&#8217;s a stir in the House! We
are missed, already!&#8221;</p>

<p>The lifeboat&#8217;s fastenings were good, but
they were arranged for her easy launching.
She was loose in a moment. Then there was
a shove, a grating sound, a splash in the
water,&mdash;but Jim&#8217;s exulting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys! Down we go! She&#8217;ll float.
All we&#8217;ve got to do is to bail her out&mdash;&#8221; was
followed by a loud shout from the front door
of the main building and through all its corridors
there were hurrying feet and rapidly
given orders, for the officers had found five
sleeping cells wide open and not a boy in
one of them.</p>

<p>About the last place in the world where
anyone would look for a missing boy, at
about two o&#8217;clock in the morning, would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
in a lifeboat on the outer side of a steam tug
in the East River.</p>

<p>The startled officers of the House of
Refuge were not at first thinking of the
river, but of things inside of their high,
strong walls, which no boy could climb over
or get through.</p>

<p>Jim and his friends in the little lifeboat
were baling her out rapidly. Of course, it
had filled on plunging in, but very quickly
enough was out for another boy to clamber
down and help without sinking her gunwale
under. Then they all came down, and they
seemed to be one shiver of mingled fear, excitement
and exultation. In a minute more,
the oars were out, and, just as two or three
men with lanterns came hurrying down toward
the wharf, Jim exclaimed, under his
breath:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull, boys!&mdash;I&#8217;ll steer out into the dark.
We&#8217;ll go with the tide. They&#8217;ll come after
us with the tug. It&#8217;s going to be a race!&#8221;</p>

<p>Four boys at the oars and one to steer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
made a fair crew for so small a boat. She
was swift, too, and so was the tide that
swept her onward, but her pursuers knew,
now, that she was gone and steam was already
up on the tug. Only a minute or so
more was wasted by them in waiting for the
engineer, and another minute in casting
loose, but every second of those minutes was
made the most of by the runaways.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes her whistle!&#8221; exclaimed one
of the rowers. &#8220;She&#8217;s after us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She can go faster than we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve a good start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No talking, boys,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Our
chance is good, yet,&mdash;Hullo!&#8221;</p>

<p>Not far ahead of him, as he sat in the
stern of the boat, he could see the lights on
a great Sound steamer, as she came puffing
along against the tide, but it struck him that
she had made her appearance, suddenly, as if
she had been hidden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;That saves
us!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>&#8220;What is it, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything happened to the tug?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming?&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Why, we are
pulling right into the thickest fog you ever
saw. It&#8217;ll cover us up so they can&#8217;t follow
us. It isn&#8217;t the tug I&#8217;m afraid of, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What then, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the telegraph!&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Our
getting out&#8217;ll be known at every police
station in the city, inside of five minutes.
We must get ashore as quick as we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an awful swift tide,&#8221; said Joe.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you run right ashore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell where you&#8217;re going, in
this fog,&#8221; said Jim, anxiously, for it seemed
to him that they had gone more than far
enough to have crossed the East River at
that narrow place, even in a slanting direction.
So they had, and all the while they
had heard the steam whistles of all sorts of
steamers answering each other through the
fog. On, on, they went, the four rowers pulling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
desperately, until Jim asked, hoarsely, as
he looked at something just beyond them:</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys!&mdash;What&#8217;s this?&mdash;I don&#8217;t know
much about New York&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was from the country, but three of
them were city boys and it was one of these
who now responded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Jim! If you haven&#8217;t steered
right into the Harlem River! That&#8217;s the
Third Avenue swing-bridge. Go right
under it. &#8217;Twasn&#8217;t far to come, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Right over their heads, now, for a moment,
was the vast shadow of the bridge,
and then, as they shot swiftly out beyond
it, Joe whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;North shore, Jim. We can get right in
among the lumber yards. Best kind of
hiding place.&mdash;We&#8217;re safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was but a minute, after that, before all
five of them were standing on a wharf, looking
back at the lifeboat, as she disappeared
in the fog, for Jim had shoved her off and
the tide had caught her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care where it carries her,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;When they find her, she can&#8217;t tell
them where she left us.&#8221;</p>

<small>A NEW HOUSE OF REFUGE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Jim</span> had a very clear idea that the city of
New York, with its thousands of sharp-eyed
policemen, was no place for him. His four
friends, however, were better acquainted
with it and they now proposed to work their
way down town before daylight, to hiding
places they said they knew of. They urged
him to come with them but he responded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Too many of us together, all in House
of Refuge grey jackets. We&#8217;d better scatter.
I&#8217;m for the country!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then it was &#8220;Good-bye, Jim!&#8221; all around,
and &#8220;O! If you haven&#8217;t done it!&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;You&#8217;re
the best kind of fellow!&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Hope we&#8217;ll see
you again, some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the House of Refuge,&#8221; said Jim.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t let them catch me. Now you&#8217;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
out, keep out, but I tell you what, boys, we
haven&#8217;t anything to say against any of those
officers.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they all said, and they were off, working
their stealthy way along among the huge
piles of lumber. How the rest got out of
the lumber yard, Jim never knew, but he
found a gap in its high, picket fence,
squeezed through it, and found himself in
an open street. It was pretty well lighted,
except for the fog, and Jim saw something,
at once, that made him shiver, a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I was afraid of!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
must wait till he moves on. He might pick
me up, any way, for being here at this time
o&#8217; night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not know that the policeman he
saw, standing under the lamp at the street
corner, was already warned and was on the
lookout for five boys who had escaped from
Randall&#8217;s Island. He was a real danger,
therefore, and Jim did well to wait patiently
until the officer marched away into the mist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Jim went forward, then, and his main idea
was to get as far away as possible from the
water-front.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; he exclaimed at the end of many
minutes of brisk walking. &#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before him seemed to be a vast hollow,
and the street he was on ran right across it,
without any buildings on either side.</p>

<p>&#8220;New street,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the new
part of the city.&mdash;There!&mdash;That&#8217;s the rap
of a policeman&#8217;s club on the sidewalk. My
only chance is to hide!&#8221;</p>

<p>Down he went, over the wall-like side of
that new street, clinging with toes and fingers
to rough projections. In a moment more
he was at the bottom, crouching close and
looking up while a man in a blue uniform
strolled slowly along the sidewalk.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t as high as the wall around the
parade-ground,&#8221; thought Jim. &#8220;That&#8217;s too
smooth to climb.&mdash;I hope the other fellows&#8217;ll
get away, now they&#8217;re out. It wasn&#8217;t just
right for me to let &#8217;em out, but I couldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
help it. It&#8217;d be awful if all the boys in the
House got away! I don&#8217;t belong there,
though. But what can I do? Where on
earth can I go?&mdash;Anyhow, I must keep hid
till daylight.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was cold, it was foggy, and his heart
sank within him as he crept slowly along the
base of the wall, on a kind of exploring expedition.
It was dreary waiting, but the
time did wear away and the fog cleared when
the sun rose.</p>

<p>People were arising, also, and Rodney Nelson
was among those who were up and
dressed very early. He had business on his
hands, now, and he stepped right out of his
own room and across the entry, into what
he was beginning to call &#8220;the store.&#8221; It
did indeed contain a great deal of counter
and some shelving, but nothing as yet, that
looked like a stock of goods.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have some, I guess,&#8221; said Rodney.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go out and take a look at the garden.
Nothing has sprouted yet, but lettuce and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
radishes, but it&#8217;s going to be the bulliest
kind of garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Downstairs he went, and his mother was
busy around the stove when he passed
through the kitchen. Somebody seemed to
be calling him, around the corner of the
house. He heard a loud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ba a-a-beh?&#8221; like a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess he&#8217;d like some breakfast,&#8221; said
Rodney, as he stepped forward.</p>

<p>There was Billy, looking down from the
edge of the sidewalk, but it was not the
goat that gave Rodney such a start of surprise.
Right before him stood a boy of
about his own age and size, dressed from
head to foot in dark, grey cloth. He seemed
a healthy enough boy, but just now his face
was very pale. He had been standing, for
Rodney had seen him, close to the wall, where
the house came against it, as if he were hiding.
On the sidewalk above, and less than a
hundred yards away, a policeman was walking
leisurely along toward the Nelson place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; said Rodney. &#8220;Who are you?
What are you down here for?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was all right to question him, but the
stranger&#8217;s face flushed suddenly and he
breathed a long, choking kind of breath,
before he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, were you ever in prison?&#8221; His
voice had a husky, despairing tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I never was!&#8221; replied Rodney, with
strong emphasis. &#8220;Was you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was,&#8221; came promptly back. &#8220;My
name&#8217;s Jim Harris, and I didn&#8217;t do a thing.
Didn&#8217;t steal a cent. But I&#8217;ve been in the
House of Refuge for a good deal more&#8217;n a
year&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you got out?&#8221; shouted Rodney, enthusiastically.
&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got out last night,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;and
they&#8217;re after me, now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney!&#8221; exclaimed an excited voice
behind him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you let them get him!
I saw him, from our house, and I came over
to tell you. If you do let them get him!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>&#8220;Of course I won&#8217;t, Millie,&#8221; said Rodney,
&#8220;but he must come right into the house.
They&#8217;d know him, right away, by his rig.&#8221;</p>

<p>Millie was thinking with all her might, and
her eyes were dancing their liveliest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rod!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Take him in! Get
him something to eat. I&#8217;ll go and get some
of Tom&#8217;s old clothes. Mother&#8217;d let him have
&#8217;em all, before she&#8217;d see him sent to prison
again. O, dear me! It was awful! And
he didn&#8217;t do anything to be sent there for,
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it was awful&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; said Rodney,
but she interrupted him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back as quick as I can. Besides,
I want to know how he got out. He must
be real hungry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and away she went.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Jim,&#8221; said Rodney. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
be safe, in our house. I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t
do it, though. Tell you what, if it had been
me, I&#8217;d ha&#8217; broke loose. How&#8217;d you ever
manage to do it? Tell us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Jim, as he followed his new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
friend, but a sudden change had come over
him.</p>

<p>His step was light and springy, and his
face was bright with new hope. He had
watched there in the raw, chilly morning
until he had grown almost desperate. Not
that he had wished himself back in the House
of Refuge, but that he had felt very tired,
very hungry, and altogether uncertain what
to do next, or where to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; shouted Rodney, with a sort
of effort not to shout quite so loud:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s from Randall&#8217;s Island! He got
away last night, and the cops are after him.
Millie&#8217;s going to bring him some of Tom&#8217;s
clothes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Why, how
did he get here?&mdash;~Now, you keep still
and let him tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was precisely what Rod was very
willing to do, and Jim was glad enough to
tell them everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Rod!&#8221; said his mother. &#8220;What if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
had been you!&mdash;His uncle ought to be
put there, himself,&mdash;and what could his
aunt have been thinking of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twasn&#8217;t her fault,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;and the
money was really gone. Somebody took it,
but I didn&#8217;t, and Uncle John may not have
been so much to blame. He never liked me
anyhow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ought not to have sent you to jail,&#8221;
said Mrs. Nelson, positively. &#8220;And I suppose
they treated you awfully. Did they
flog you much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;They never
flog anybody. It&#8217;s the best place in the
world for loads of those boys. They get a
chance to learn something and they have to
behave themselves. What I mean is that I
didn&#8217;t do anything to go there for, and I
didn&#8217;t belong there. They&#8217;re the best kind
of men for the boys that ought to be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He really came up with a good deal of energy
to the defence of the House of Refuge
and its management, but he was tremendously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
in earnest in his assertion that he would not
go back there again. He had hardly completed
his wonderful story of escape, before
the door of the kitchen opened, half stealthily,
and they heard the voice of Mrs. Kirby:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go right in, Millie. Don&#8217;t say a word.
Don&#8217;t speak about him. Somebody else
might be there and hear you. Don&#8217;t you run
any risk of anybody&#8217;s knowing what they&#8217;re
for. If they don&#8217;t fit him, I can alter them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come right in, Mrs. Kirby,&#8221; called out
Mrs. Nelson, but Millie was in first, with her
arms full of coats, trousers and other matters,
that had nothing grey about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the checker!&#8221; shouted Rod.
&#8220;That old blue. It&#8217;s patched, some, but
it&#8217;ll do first-rate. He won&#8217;t look like the
same fellow. Come on, Jim. Come into
the front room and put &#8217;em on. Mother,
you tell &#8217;em just how it was.&mdash;Guess the
cops won&#8217;t get him out of our house.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was plainly no danger that anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
now in it would help them, and Jim&#8217;s
possible peril from anybody else was certainly
very much less when, a few minutes
later, he came back into the kitchen. Mrs.
Nelson had, meantime, been telling his story,
as he told it, with sympathetic additions of
her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;It fits him!&#8221; shouted Millie, but her
mother exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney! What did you put on him
that old red necktie for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess there isn&#8217;t anything like it on
Randall&#8217;s Island,&#8221; said Rodney. &#8220;All he&#8217;s
got to do, now, is to keep still till they stop
hunting for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re hunting, everywhere, just now,&#8221;
remarked Jim. &#8220;I wish I knew what had
become of those other fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just you come and eat your breakfast,&#8221;
said Mrs. Nelson. &#8220;Don&#8217;t mind them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must go home,&#8221; said Millie, &#8220;and I
can&#8217;t come right back. I&#8217;ve a lot of type-setting
to do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>&#8220;I can set type,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;I was in the
printing office, all the while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Kirby.
&#8220;Come right over, after breakfast. The last
place they&#8217;d look into would be Mr. Kirby&#8217;s
office. You can earn something, too.&#8221;</p>

<small>JIM&#8217;S HIDING PLACE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Jim</span> enjoyed his breakfast, exceedingly.
It was the first he had eaten, for a long time,
without any rules against talking. It seemed
as if everybody in the room talked all the
while. After it was over, he and Rodney
went to the door and looked out.</p>

<p>The wide, bare space, in which the Nelson
garden was beginning to grow, was not much
like the House of Refuge parade-ground, although
it seemed to have pretty high, stone
walls on three of its sides and a row of
buildings on the other. These were different
buildings and nearly in the middle of the
row was the Kirby place, instead of the
Randall&#8217;s Island printing office. It looked
very much as if all this had been getting
ready to take Jim in, whenever he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
get away from the Island. He had a strong,
oppressive feeling, however, that he had not
yet entirely escaped.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll think it was awful wrong for me
to get away,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;It&#8217;s just as if it
was as bad as stealing to have ever been sent
there. How shall I get rid of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had all the while, month after month,
been suffering under a sense of terrible injustice,
and now it stung him again, for it
was following him, and so, he knew, were
men who deemed it their duty to catch him
and take him back.</p>

<p>Rodney, too, was thinking of that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Kirby&#8217;s printing office is
better than working in our garden. They
might see you, from the sidewalk, and ask
where you came from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I could tell &#8217;em, with these
clothes on,&#8221; laughed Jim, for his spirits were
improving and it seemed to him as if Randall&#8217;s
Island were drifting away.</p>

<p>At that very moment, in the Bronson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
farmhouse, away up the Hudson, they were
talking about Jim.</p>

<p>A man had come in, just at breakfast time,
and had said something which made everybody
jump.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Squire? Did you say it
was a telegraphic despatch from Randall&#8217;s
Island that Jim&#8217;s got out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God if he had!&#8221; exclaimed Aunt
Betty, and it looked as if she would have
clapped her hands, or danced, if she had not
been so anxious to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim and four more of &#8217;em,&#8221; said the
Squire. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t tell how they did it,
but they might come right here, or he might,
and you&#8217;d ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know all about it,&#8221; said Uncle
John Bronson, slowly. &#8220;If you hear anything
more, let me know. Jim may not
come this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; said the Squire, &#8220;but I
just want to say one thing. We&#8217;re old neighbors,
and Jim&#8217;s a right likely young fellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
I can&#8217;t guess how he beat &#8217;em, but if he
should get up this way, and you or his aunt
knew where he was, you needn&#8217;t say too
much to me. You see, it would be my duty
to catch him, and I&#8217;d have to do my duty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, no! Never!&#8221; broke in Aunt Betty.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say a word! I wouldn&#8217;t be so
mean as to put that on you. John wouldn&#8217;t
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Squire,&#8221; said Uncle John, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know a word about it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more do I,&#8221; said the Squire, turning
to go out. &#8220;Good morning.&mdash;But he&#8217;s a
plucky young fellow, now, I tell you. How
they did it, I don&#8217;t see.&mdash;I&#8217;d have to take
him. Of course I would. I&#8217;d do my duty.&mdash;But
I don&#8217;t really believe they need Jim
Harris, much, on Randall&#8217;s Island.&#8221;</p>

<p>So different people, in places widely apart,
were aware of Jim&#8217;s escape and were taking
their own peculiar view of the matter.
Quite a number were wishing they knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
how he did it but they had not yet found
out.</p>

<p>A sea tide ebbs with as much force and
swiftness as it flowed in with, and it will
carry loads both ways. This was the reason
why when the House of Refuge lifeboat was
found, some hours after it was shoved off by
Jim and his crew, it was found knocking
against the side of a pier away down, near
the middle of the city. Therefore it gave
no hint as to where it had landed the runaways.
Only an hour or so later, however,
the police knew a little more, for they managed
to capture poor Joe. He had been altogether
too confident and had walked out into
the street too soon, without changing his grey
uniform for every day clothes. He was a little
chopfallen, at first, but he really could not
tell much about the other boys. He was at
once ferried over to the Island and brought
face to face with his old friends, the officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you run away for, Joe?&#8221; asked
the pleasant faced Superintendent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know, sir,&#8221; replied Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t we treat you well?&#8221; asked the
Military Instructor, for Joe had been a lieutenant
in one of the companies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you did,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;But,
tell you what, I&#8217;d as lief come back, but
then, any fellow&#8217;d get away, if he had Jim to
show him how.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Big adventure!&#8221; exclaimed another officer.</p>

<p>That was indeed a part of it, and there
was no reason, now, why Joe should conceal
anything. He went with them to the dormitory
and explained about the locks. Then
they walked out into the parade-ground,
where the empty boxes still lay at the machine
shop wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;We went over the roof,&#8221; said Joe, and
every man who heard him tell how they did
it agreed with the Superintendent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim is a genius!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Not
one boy in a thousand could have planned
and carried out that escape.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>&#8220;He&#8217;s a captain!&#8221; added the skipper of
the steam tug. &#8220;But we&#8217;d have caught &#8217;em,
if it hadn&#8217;t been for that fog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall get them all, before long,&#8221; said
Jim&#8217;s friend, the naval officer. &#8220;All but
Jim. I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ve lost him. I&#8217;m sorry.
I did want to do something more for that
boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The very kindly man in charge of the
House of Refuge printing office also remarked
that it was a pity Jim should run
away, just when he was learning his trade so
fast and so well. He could hardly have
guessed that Jim was already at a case in
another shop, setting type as busily as usual.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirby himself, a grey-haired, silent
man, with a queer kind of smile on his face,
was working at the press in another room,
but Jim was not the only type-setter. At
the next case stood Millie, and between them
and the door were other ranges of cases, and
two of these were journeymen printers. All
were seemingly absorbed in their type-sticking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
when a man in a blue uniform opened the
street door and strolled in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Kirby?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the press room,&#8221; said Millie, but her
hand slipped, as she spoke, and all the type
in her half filled &#8220;stick&#8221; went rattling down
on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all pi,&#8221; laughed the policeman as
he strode on to the press room door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kirby,&#8221; he said, &#8220;did you hear about the
escape of those young fellows, last night,
from the House of Refuge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got out, did they?&#8221; asked Mr. Kirby.
&#8220;I guess it isn&#8217;t in the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too soon,&#8221; said the officer. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
they want it printed, either. It&#8217;s no
fault of theirs, but they want to catch the
boys. Smartest escape&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and then he
went on with an account of it which contained
as many blunders as Jim was just
then making in his type-setting. At the end
of it, however, the officer said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, two of &#8217;em are printers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
one&#8217;s a pretty good one. They&#8217;re likely to
look for work in their own trade, soon as
they can get off their prison rig. If they
should come to you, now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A boy&#8217;d be just hidden away in one of
the big printing houses, down town,&#8221; said
Mr. Kirby. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we could,&#8221; said the officer. &#8220;Every
man and boy in each one of them is already
registered by the place itself and by the
trades unions. We could find out just
where he came from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you register my office?&#8221;
asked Mr. Kirby. &#8220;You can take down the
name of every fellow here, this morning, so
that if any new fellow should come you
could mark him. Register me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need to,&#8221; said the officer. &#8220;Nor
your daughter, nor the hands. I&#8217;ll remember
all of &#8217;em, well enough. If I see a new
boy here, any time, I can ask about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mr. Kirby, but Millie
was picking up her scattered type and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
jour&#8217; printers exchanged winks as the policeman
walked out.</p>

<p>Those very printers, that morning, had
threatened to leave the shop if Mr. Kirby
took in a new boy who was not a member of
their Printers&#8217; Union.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just you listen to me, boys,&#8221; Mr. Kirby
had said. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t one of you mean
enough&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and he told them the whole
story.</p>

<p>He was right. Not one of them was
mean enough to give up Jim. Their very
hearts went out to a fellow who had been
shut up unjustly and who had made so
daring an escape. It was not at all, they
said, as if he had really deserved to be
shut up.</p>

<small>THE STOLEN MONEY</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Rodney Nelson parted from Jim,
at Kirby&#8217;s printing office, that morning, he
walked away with a strange look of energy
and determination on his face. What the
meaning of it was did not come out until his
mother reached home, after her hard day&#8217;s
work. She was very tired and for once
she actually complained and said how hard
it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; instantly burst from Rodney.
&#8220;That&#8217;s it. I guess you won&#8217;t have to work
so hard, any more&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Rodney, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been at it, all day, mother. I&#8217;ve
found people,&mdash;found &#8217;em easy,&mdash;that&#8217;ll let
us have things to sell. Don&#8217;t you see? You
own your store, and you&#8217;ve cash to start
with, and you don&#8217;t pay rent or clerk hire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Your credit&#8217;s good and they want to see you
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Of course
we can! But what made you think of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Jim,&#8221; said Rodney. &#8220;I thought
if he could find a way out, I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go out to work any more&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
and Mrs. Nelson almost cried as she and her
boy went over the particulars of it and she
saw how easy it would be.</p>

<p>There were days and days, after that,
during which nothing exciting happened, but
in each of which a great deal of work was
done. Aunt Betty Bronson, in her farmhouse
home, passed them in a state of half
nervous expectation. There was a kind of
daily disappointment, too, until one broad,
bright noon when she met Uncle John, at
the door, with a face that was almost blazing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Letter from Jim!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;He&#8217;s
safe and they can&#8217;t catch him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop right there, Betty,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
don&#8217;t want to know where he is. I&#8217;m glad
he&#8217;s doing well. Don&#8217;t say any more, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t, then,&#8221; she replied, but it was
hard to keep her word.</p>

<p>As for Uncle John, there was something
heavy on his mind, for he sat down to his
dinner with a face that looked very much as
if he were about to be taken sick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it kind o&#8217; hurts him,&#8221; thought
Aunt Betty, &#8220;but he ought never to have
been so hard on Jim about that money. I
never believed Jim took it!&#8221;</p>

<p>If Uncle John doubted it, he did not say
so, but that was an important day for all of
them. Just a little after dinner time, Rodney
and his mother were in their store. It
was getting to look very business like and
several customers had been waited on and
had gone out, while Billy looked hard at the
things in the show window and remarked,
repeatedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ba-a-a-beh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody else was there, therefore, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Millie came hurrying up the back stairs and
dashed in, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Nelson! Rodney! One of the
men told father the police have found out!
Jim&#8217;s up in the back room, now. They&#8217;ve
caught three of the other boys that were
with him. Father says he mustn&#8217;t come
back to the shop!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must get out of town!&#8221; said Mrs.
Nelson, excitedly. &#8220;Rodney can go along
and help!&mdash;He must jump!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they all say,&#8221; gasped Millie, all out
of breath. &#8220;Father and the men gave him
ten dollars. He hasn&#8217;t any time to spare.
They&#8217;re watching the shop!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rodney had rushed for the back room and
there was Jim, looking pretty cool but with
a very determined expression gathering
around his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim!&#8221; exclaimed Rodney. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
ready in a minute. I can show you how to
get out, if we&#8217;re quick about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jim, and he added, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
himself: &#8220;I want to see Aunt Betty once
more, and tell her I didn&#8217;t do it. Then I&#8217;ll
go somewhere else, where they don&#8217;t know
me. I won&#8217;t let them take me back to the
Island.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the store, Millie was saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to &#8217;tend shop while Rod&#8217;s
gone. I&#8217;d rather, a hundred times, any day,
than stand and set type.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay here, then,&#8221; said Mrs. Nelson,
&#8220;while I go and get a luncheon-tin filled for
them to take along. They mustn&#8217;t catch
Jim!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was hardly any time at all before all
was ready, but the good-byes were said in a
hurry, for Rodney remarked to Jim:</p>

<p>&#8220;We can do it, if we&#8217;re off before any of
&#8217;em see us go. We can catch a train and
then we&#8217;re all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had evidently talked it all over before
hand, because it was likely to happen,
and so they were not altogether taken by
surprise when it came.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>It was not very late in that afternoon when
a pair of young fellows were walking along
a country road and one of them turned to
the other, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;This road takes us right around the
village, Rodney. I guess we won&#8217;t meet
anybody but we can cut across a field if we
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can cut before they know who it is,&#8221;
said Rodney, but he felt a great deal more
nervousness than Jim was showing, and he
looked at him with open admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Rodney,&#8221; remarked Jim, half a
mile further on, &#8220;this isn&#8217;t night, it&#8217;s daytime,
but it kind o&#8217; feels as if the House of
Refuge dormitory was only a little way behind
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope it isn&#8217;t catching up,&#8221; said Rodney.</p>

<p>Jim said nothing, but it was not long before
he led the way through a front gate,
around through a shrubberied houseyard,
and right in at a kitchen door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Betty?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>&#8220;Jim!&#8221; almost screamed Mrs. Bronson,
Springing forward to throw her arms around
his neck. &#8220;You? Here?&mdash;O, my boy!
My boy! I&#8217;m so glad! What would your
mother say, if she were alive!&mdash;They didn&#8217;t
catch you, did they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Aunt Betty,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;This is
Rodney Nelson. He isn&#8217;t one of the House
of Refuge boys. He and his folks helped
me. I&#8217;ll tell you all about it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now!&mdash;Not now!&#8221; she said, excitedly.
&#8220;O dear! What shall I do with
you! What shall I say to your uncle? It&#8217;s
awful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d say it was!&#8221; suddenly broke in a
deep, strong voice in the doorway. &#8220;Worst
thing could ha&#8217; happened to me! Mrs.
Bronson, I just don&#8217;t want to know it&#8217;s
Jim. Wish I hadn&#8217;t happened to come&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Squire,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is Jim, and
he&#8217;s got away from all of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do any such duty,&#8221;
groaned the Squire. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard on me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
have to take him. I knew his father and his
mother.&mdash;Wish I wasn&#8217;t a justice-peace!
Who cares what he stole!&mdash;That money&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That money&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; came like an echo,
from a voice that was drawing nearer, in
the next room.</p>

<p>&#8220;John!&#8221; shouted Aunt Betty. &#8220;You
won&#8217;t have the Squire take Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Betty!&#8221; exclaimed Uncle John.
&#8220;Why, Squire, I don&#8217;t know what to say.
It&#8217;s awful!&mdash;Tell you what.&mdash;I can&#8217;t, but I
must.&mdash;Jim never stole a cent.&mdash;Betty, do
you mind those old, blue jeans overalls?&mdash;I
had &#8217;em on, that day. When the money was
missed, I was so torn up by it, I didn&#8217;t remember
where I&#8217;d put &#8217;em. I found &#8217;em,
hangin&#8217; up in the barn, three days ago, and
there was the fifty dollars, in one o&#8217; the
pockets. I was most sick. O, Jim, I&#8217;m a
poor, old, miserable sinner! I&#8217;m glad you
got out&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; ejaculated the Squire.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got to do it! Hurrah!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; shouted Rodney, but Jim
could not have said a word, if he had tried,
for Aunt Betty was almost choking him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Bronson,&#8221; said the Squire.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll telegraph to the New York authorities.
&#8217;Twon&#8217;t really hurt Jim, in the long run.
I&#8217;m going&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go, too,&#8221; said Rodney. &#8220;I want to
send word to our folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come right back, Rodney,&#8221; said Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Rodney, but he was hurrying
away with the Squire and one of the consequences
was that when, just before supper
time, Mr. and Mrs. Kirby came over to the
Nelson store to ask if there was any news, a
telegraph messenger went in with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read it aloud! What is it?&#8221; exclaimed
Mrs. Kirby. &#8220;Is it from Rod?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, do hear!&#8221; said Mrs. Kirby, and she
read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother. We got here. They found the
money. Jim&#8217;s all right. He didn&#8217;t do it.
Tell Millie. Tell everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>&#8220;Whoop!&#8221; shouted Mr. Kirby, but his
wife was reaching out after the telegram
that Mrs. Nelson was waving, like a flag,
and Millie was dancing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ba-a-a-beh!&#8221; remarked a bearded friend
of the family, in the doorway.</p>

<p>Away over on Randall&#8217;s Island, in the
main office of the House of Refuge, a bright-faced
officer was reading a very much longer
telegram. When it was completed, he remarked,
to a pair of his blue uniformed associates
and to another pair who were not in
uniform:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad he is innocent. I&#8217;m glad we
did our duty by him.&mdash;Well, after all, I&#8217;m
glad the right boy got away.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Only a few years have gone by. Only
long enough for the new avenue to be built up
on both sides. In the middle of the western
side is a sign that reads &#8220;R. Nelson,&#8221; and
the Nelson family live under that store.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
They have frequent visits from a young man
they call &#8220;Jim,&#8221; who runs a printing office,
in a village about fifty miles up the Hudson.
He lives at the Bronson farm, near the village,
and when he comes to the city he
spends a great deal of his time at the house
of Mr. Kirby, the printer, on the other
avenue, for he worked in Kirby&#8217;s shop, once.
He told them, at his last visit, of a grand
time he had had with a friend of his named
Joe, a junior officer on one of the Sound
Steamers, who came all the way up there to
let him know how well three of their old
friends were doing. Boys who once climbed
over walls with them and were now sailors
in the Navy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad, for me
and for them, that it turned out just as it
did. It was best for all of us. But somehow
the whole business makes me think of
what I heard the Superintendent say, once,
to some of those Managers:</p>

<p>&#8220;In prison, and ye visited ME.&#8221;</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
